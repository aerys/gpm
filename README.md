## 3. Getting started

### 3.1. Creating a package repository

1. Create a [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) enabled Git repository, for example a GitHub or GitLab repository.
2. [Install git-lfs](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Installation) on your local computer.
3. Clone the newly created repository on your local computer:

```bash
git clone ssh://path.to/my/package-repository.git
cd package-repository
```

4. Enable [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) tracking for `*.tar.gz` files:

```bash
git lfs track "*.tar.gz"
```

5. Add, commit and push `.gitattributes`:

```bash
git add .gitattributes
git commit .gitattributes -m "Enable git-lfs."
git push
```

VoilÃ ! You're all set to publish your first package!

### 3.2. Publishing your first package

In this example, we're going to create a simple `hello-world` package and publish it.

1. Make sure you are at the root of the package repository created in the previous section.
2. Create and enter the package directory:

```bash
mkdir hello-world && cd hello-world
```

3. Create the `hello-world.sh` script:

```bash
echo "#/bin/sh\necho 'Hello World!'" > hello-world.sh
```

4. Create your package archive:

```bash
tar -cvzf hello-world.tar.gz hello-world.sh
```

5. Add and commit your package archive:

```bash
git add hello-world.tar.gz
git commit hello-world.tar.gz -m "Publish hello-world version 1.0"
```

6. Tag your package release with a specific version number:

```bash
git tag hello-world/1.0
```

7. Push your new package:

```bash
git push
git push --tags
```

Your `hello-world/1.0` package is now stored in your package repository and can be installed using `gpm`!

### 3.3. Installing your first package

1. Install (or build) `gpm`.
2. Add your package repository to the `gpm` sources:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.gpm/sources.list
echo "ssh://path.to/my/package-repository.git" >> ~/.gpm/sources.list
```

3. Update the `gpm` cache:

```bash
gpm update
```

4. Install your package:

```bash
gpm install hello-world/1.0 --prefix ~/
```

Your `hello-world/1.0` package is now installed and you can run it with `sh ~/hello-world.sh`.

## 4. Authentication

`gpm` will behave a lot like `git` regarding authentication.

If the repository is "public", then no authentication should be required.

Otherwise, the following authentication methods are supported:
* URL encoded HTTP basic authentication (ex: `https://username:password@host.com/repo.git`);
* SSH public/private key.

If URL encoded HTTP basic authentication is used, no additional authentication is required.
Otherwise, `gpm` will assume SSH public/private key authentication is used.

If SSH public/private key authentication is used:
* if the `GPM_SSH_KEY` environment variable is set to a path that exists/is a file, then its value is used as the path to the SSH private key;
* otherwise, if `gpm` can find the `~/.ssh/config` file, parse it and find a matching host with the `IndentityFile` option; then the corresponding
path to the SSH private key will be used;
* otherwise, if `gpm` can find the `~/.ssh/id_rsa` file, it is used as the SSH private key;
* otherwise, `gpm` will continue without authentication.

If the SSH private key requires a passphrase, then:
* if the `GPM_SSH_PASS` environment variable is set/not empty, it is used as the passphrase;
* otherwise, `gpm` will prompt the user to type his passphrase.

## 5. Package reference notation

### 5.1. Package name

#### 5.1.1. Shorthand notation

This is the most trivial, obvious and simple notation: simply use the package name.

Example:

```
gpm install my-package
```

`gpm` will search by name for the specified package in all the available package
repositories. Thus, for such package reference to be found, you *must* make sure:

* the corresponding package repository remote is listed in `~/.gpm/sources.list` (see
[Working with multiple package repositories](#7-working-with-multiple-package-repositories)),
* the cache has been updated by calling `gpm update`.

#### 5.1.2. URI notation

The complete URI notation for a package is as follow:

`${remote-uri}#${package}`

where:

* `remote-uri` is the full URI to the Git remote,
* `package` is a shorthand or `${name}=${revision}` package reference.

Example:

```bash
gpm install ssh://github.com/my/awesome-packages.git#my-package
```

In this case, `gpm` will clone the corresponding Git repository and look for the package there.
`gpm` will look for the specified package *only* in the specified repository.

### 5.2. Package version

#### 5.2.1. SemVer notation

The version of a package can be specified using the
[SemVer](https://semver.org/) version requirement notation:

`${package}${semver_req}`

where:

* `package` is the name of the package (ex: `my-package`),
* `semver_req` is the semver version requirement (ex: `^0.4.2`). If not
specified, then the latest version will be installed.

It also allows parsing of `~x.y.z` and `^x.y.z` requirements as defined
at https://www.npmjs.org/doc/misc/semver.html.

Tilde requirements specify a minimal version with some updates:

```
~1.2.3 := >=1.2.3 <1.3.0
~1.2   := >=1.2.0 <1.3.0
~1     := >=1.0.0 <2.0.0
```

Caret requirements allow SemVer compatible updates to a specified verion,
`0.x` and `0.x+1` are not considered compatible, but `1.x and `1.x+1 are.

0.0.x is not considered compatible with any other version. Missing minor and
patch versions are desugared to 0 but allow flexibility for that value.

```
^1.2.3 := >=1.2.3 <2.0.0
^0.2.3 := >=0.2.3 <0.3.0
^0.0.3 := >=0.0.3 <0.0.4
^0.0   := >=0.0.0 <0.1.0
^0     := >=0.0.0 <1.0.0
```

Wildcard requirements allows parsing of version requirements of the formats
`*`, `x.*` and `x.y.*`.

```
*     := >=0.0.0
1.*   := >=1.0.0 <2.0.0
1.2.* := >=1.2.0 <1.3.0
```

Example:

```bash
gpm install my-package>=2.0.0
```

#### 5.2.2. Git refspec notation

A package version can also be set to a valid
[Git refspec](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-The-Refspec),
such as a specific branch or a tag, using the `@` operator:

`${package}@${refspec}`

where:

* `package` is the name of the package (ex: `my-package`),
* `refspec` is a valid Git refspec (ex: `refs/heads/my-branch` or `refs/tags/my-tag`).

## 6. Matching package references

The following section explains how `gpm` finds the package archive for a package named `${package_name}` at version `${package_version}`.

The following pseudo code explains how GPM will find packages for a specific version:

```
if ${package_ref} includes remote URL
    git clone URL

if ${package_ref} does not include version
    ${package_version} is set to "@master"

for each ${repository} in cache
    git checkout master
    git reset --hard

    if ${package_version} is refspec
        git checkout ${package_version}
    else # assume ${package_version} is semver
        for each ${tag} in ${repository}
            if ${tag} matches semver
                git checkout ${tag}
    
    if file ${package_name}/${package_name}.tgz exists
        if ${package_name}/${package_name}.tgz is LFS link
            download ${package_name}/${package_name}.tgz
        extract ${package_name}/${package_name}.tgz
```

## 7. Working with multiple package repositories

Specifying a full package URI might not be practical. It's simpler to specify a package
refspec and let `gpm` find it. But where should it look for it?

When you specify a package using a refspec, `gpm` will have to find the proper package
repository. It will look for this refspec in the repositories listed in `~/.gpm/sources.list`.

The following command lines will fill `sources.list` with a few (dummy) package repositories:

```bash
echo "ssh://path.to/my/package-repository.git" >> ~/.gpm/sources.list
echo "ssh://path.to/my/another-repository.git" >> ~/.gpm/sources.list
echo "ssh://path.to/my/yet-another-repository.git" >> ~/.gpm/sources.list
# ...
```

After updating `sources.list`, don't forget to call `gmp update` to update the cache.

You can then install packages using their refspec.

## 8. Logging

Logs can be enable by setting the `GPM_LOG` environment variable to one of the following values:

* `trace`
* `debug`
* `info`
* `warn`
* `error`

Example:

```bash
GPM_LOG=info gpm update
```

Logs can be *very* verbose. So it's best to keep only the `gpm` and `gitlfs` module logs.
For example:

```bash
GPM_LOG="gpm=debug,gitlfs=debug" gpm install hello-world/1.0
```

## 9. Commands

### 9.1. `update`

Update the cache to feature the latest revision of each repository listed in `~/.gpm/sources.list`.

Example:

```bash
# first add at least one remote
echo "ssh://github.com/my/awesome-packages.git" >> ~/.gpm/sources.list
echo "ssh://github.com/my/other-packages.git" >> ~/.gpm/sources.list
# ...
# then you can run an update:
gpm update
```

### 9.2. `clean`

Clean the cache. The cache is located in `~/.gpm/cache`.
Cache can be rebuilt using the `update` command.

```bash
gpm clean
```

### 9.3. `install`

Download and install a package.

Example:

```bash
# install the "app" package at version 2.0 from repository ssh://github.com/my/awesome-packages.git
# in the /var/www/app folder
gpm install ssh://github.com/my/awesome-packages.git#app/2.0 \
    --prefix /var/www/app
```

```bash
# assuming the repository ssh://github.com/my/awesome-packages.git is in ~/.gpm/sources.list
# and the cache has been updated using `gpm update`
gpm install app/2.0 --prefix /var/www/app
```

### 9.4. `download`

Download a package in the current working directory.

Example:

```bash
# install the "app" package at version 2.0 from repository ssh://github.com/my/awesome-packages.git
# in the /var/www/app folder
gpm download ssh://github.com/my/awesome-packages.git#app/2.0 \
    --prefix /var/www/app
```

```bash
# assuming the repository ssh://github.com/my/awesome-packages.git is in ~/.gpm/sources.list
# and the cache has been updated using `gpm update`
gpm download app/2.0 --prefix /var/www/app
```

## 10. CI integration

### 10.1. Travis CI

Here is a working Bash script to publish a package from Travis CI: [script/publish.sh](script/publish.sh).

### 10.2. AppVeyor

Here is a working PowerShell script to publish a package from AppVeyor: [script/publish.ps1](script/publish.ps1).

### 10.3. GitLab CI

Here is a template to publish a package from GitLab CI:

```yml
.gpm_publish_template: &gpm_publish_template
  stage: archive
  only:
    - tags
  variables:
  script:
    - cd ${PACKAGE_ARCHIVE_ROOT} && tar -zcf /tmp/${PACKAGE_NAME}.tar.gz * && cd -
    - echo "${PACKAGE_REPOSITORY_KEY}" > /tmp/package-repository-key && chmod 700 /tmp/package-repository-key
    - mkdir -p ~/.ssh && echo -e "Host *\n  StrictHostKeyChecking no\n  IdentityFile /tmp/package-repository-key" > ~/.ssh/config
    - GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 git clone ${PACKAGE_REPOSITORY} /tmp/package-repository
    - mkdir -p /tmp/package-repository/${PACKAGE_NAME}
    - mv /tmp/${PACKAGE_NAME}.tar.gz /tmp/package-repository/${PACKAGE_NAME}
    - cd /tmp/package-repository/${PACKAGE_NAME}
    - git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
    - git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    - git add ${PACKAGE_NAME}.tar.gz
    - git commit ${PACKAGE_NAME}.tar.gz -m "Publish ${PACKAGE_NAME} version ${PACKAGE_VERSION}."
    - git tag ${PACKAGE_NAME}/${PACKAGE_VERSION}
    - git push
    - git push --tags
```

and an example of how to use this template:

```yml
gpm-publish:
  <<: *gpm_publish_template
  variables:
    PACKAGE_VERSION: ${CI_COMMIT_TAG} # the version of the package
    PACKAGE_REPOSITORY: ssh://my.gitlab.com/my-packages.git # the package repository to publish to
    PACKAGE_NAME: ${CI_PROJECT_NAME} # the name of the package
    PACKAGE_ARCHIVE_ROOT: ${CI_PROJECT_DIR} # the folder containing the files to put in the package archive
```

This template relies on the `PACKAGE_REPOSITORY_KEY` GitLab CI variable.
It must contain a passphrase-less SSH deploy key (with write permissions) to your package repository.

## 11. FAQ

### 11.1. Why GPM?

GPM means "Git-based Package Manager".

The main motivation is to have a platform-agnostic package manager, mainly aimed at distributing binary packages as archives.
GPM can be used to leverage any Git repository as a package repository.

Platforms like GitLab and GitHub are then very handy to manage such package archives, permissions, etc...

GPM is also available as an all-in-one static binary.
It can be leveraged to download some packages that will be used to bootstrap a more complex provisioning process.

### 11.2. Why Git? Why not just `curl` or `wget` or whatever?

GPM aims at leveraging the Git ecosystem and features.

Git is great to manage revisions. So it's great at managing package versions!
For example, Git is also used by the Docker registry to store Docker images.

Git also has a safe and secured native authentication/authorization strategy through SSH.
With GitLab, you can safely setup [deploy keys](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ssh/README.html#deploy-keys) to give a read-only access to your packages.

### 11.3. But Git does not like large binary files!

Yes. Cloning a repository full of large binary files can take a lot of time and space.
You certainly don't want to checkout all the versions of all your packages everytime you want to install one of them.

That's why you should use [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) for your GPM repositories.

Thanks to [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/), GPM will download the a actual binary package only when it is required.

### 11.4. Why storing packages as `*.tar.gz` archives?

Vanilla Git will compress objects. But [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) doesn't store objects in the actual Git
repository: they are stored "somewhere else".

To make sure we don't use too much disk space/bandwidth "somewhere else", the
package archive is stored compressed.
